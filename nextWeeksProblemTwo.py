Mr Davis
ICS3U Class Problem

1. Create a List (or an array) filled with random numbers from 0 to 200
2. Create a second List that is identical to the first list BUT the numbers are in BINARY.
3. Create a third list to hold the upcoming changes. The first and second list should be unchanged.
3. Create a function that checks if the binary number has a '101' anywhere in the number. If so,
copy the number to the third list AND make the number negative. If not, copy the number
to the third list and add "00" (two zeros) to the end of the number.
4. Create a fourth list that is a copy of the third list, but converted back to base-10

Hints
1. you will need to import the random library
2. you will need the python function bin()
3. to convert a binary to base 10, you will use the alternate function of int("1110101", 2)
